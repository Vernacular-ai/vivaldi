Tools for working with VIVA data formats. Vivaldi provide types and transforms
for call and turn data from our voice bot.

Types specifying calls and turns, and few common functions are accessible in the
~vivaldi~ python package. Use ~pip install vivaldi~ for getting it.

If you are developing in some language other than python, refer to the protobuf
schema in ~./asserts/vivaldi.proto~.
